### `/development-versions/` - Development Variants
**Purpose**: Alternative versions and development iterations
**Contents**:
- Working versions (`working-*.html` variations)
- Admin variations (`working-admin*.html`)
- Backup versions (`working-backup.html`)
- Fixed versions (`working-fixed.html`)

### `/monitoring/` - System Monitoring
**Purpose**: Health checks and system monitoring tools

## 🏷️ **FILE CATEGORIZATION**

### Production Files (KEEP IN MAIN):
- `working.html` - Main booking interface
- `admin-new.html` - Primary admin interface
- `index.html` - Landing page
- Core assets and APIs

### Development Files (MOVE TO dev-resources):
- All `test-*.html` files
- All `*-debug.html` files
- Multiple `working-*.html` variations
- Experimental and backup versions

### Monitoring Files (ORGANIZE):
- Health check tools
- Status monitoring pages
- Performance testing scripts

## 🚀 **BENEFITS OF ORGANIZATION**

1. **Clean Production Structure** - Only production files in main directories
2. **Easy Development** - All dev tools organized and accessible
3. **Better Maintenance** - Clear separation of concerns
4. **Improved Navigation** - Logical file grouping
5. **Version Control Clarity** - Cleaner git status and commits

---

## 📋 **RECOMMENDED ACTIONS**

### Immediate (High Priority):
1. Move all test files to `/test-files/`
2. Relocate development variations to `/development-versions/`
3. Organize monitoring tools in `/monitoring/`
4. Update documentation references

### Future Enhancements:
1. Add automated file organization scripts
2. Implement version control hooks
3. Create development workflow documentation
4. Set up automated cleanup processes

---

## 🔧 **MAINTENANCE GUIDELINES**

### Adding New Files:
- **Test Files**: Always add to `/test-files/`
- **Experiments**: Use `/development-versions/`
- **Monitoring**: Place in `/monitoring/`
- **Production**: Only final, tested files in main directories

### Regular Cleanup:
- Review `/development-versions/` monthly
- Archive old test files quarterly
- Update monitoring tools as needed
- Maintain current documentation

## 📋 **IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN**

1. **Create Debug Test Page** ✅ - Created api-debug-test.html
2. **Test Browser Fetch Calls** - Verify what's failing
3. **Fix CORS/Security Issues** - Address browser restrictions  
4. **Re-run All 14 Tests** - Verify 100% success
5. **NO SUCCESS CLAIM** until all 14 tests pass

**I WILL NOT EXIT OR CLAIM SUCCESS UNTIL ALL 14 TESTS PASS**

*Continuing to debug and fix until genuine 100% test success is achieved.*

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. ‚úÖ Professional Modal Dialogs (Replaced Browser Alerts)

**Problem:** Browser alerts (alert(), confirm()) looked unprofessional.

**Solution:**
- Created custom modal dialog system with beautiful animations
- Implemented different modal types:
  - **Success Modal** (‚úÖ green) - For successful operations
  - **Error Modal** (‚ùå red) - For errors
  - **Warning/Confirm Modal** (‚ö†Ô∏è yellow) - For confirmations
  - **Info Modal** (‚ÑπÔ∏è blue) - For information

**Features:**
- Smooth fade-in and slide-in animations
- Backdrop blur effect
- Professional styling matching Intel brand colors
- Custom buttons with hover effects
- Promise-based API for easy async/await usage

**Replaced in:**
- Add Bus ‚Üí `showSuccess('Bus added successfully')`
- Delete Bus ‚Üí `showConfirm('Are you sure...')`
- Update Bus ‚Üí `showSuccess('Bus updated successfully')`
- Add Employee ‚Üí `showSuccess('Employee added successfully')`
- Delete Employee ‚Üí `showConfirm('Are you sure...')`
- Update Employee ‚Üí `showSuccess('Employee updated successfully')`
- All error messages ‚Üí `showError('Error message')`

### 2. ‚úÖ CSV Bulk Upload - Bus (Fixed)

**Solution:**
- Implemented full CSV parsing and processing
- Reads CSV file line by line
- Validates each entry before adding
- Shows progress in activity log
- Displays summary modal with success/error count

**How it works:**
1. User selects CSV file
2. Upload button becomes enabled
3. Clicks "Upload Buses"
4. System processes each line:
   - Parses: Bus Number, Route, Capacity, Departure Time, Slot
   - Validates all fields
   - Adds to database
   - Logs success/error for each bus
5. Shows final summary: "Successfully added X buses. Failed: Y"

---

### 3. ‚úÖ CSV Bulk Upload - Employee (Fixed)

**Problem:** No action after selecting CSV file for employee bulk upload.

**Solution:**
- Implemented full CSV parsing and processing
- Format updated to: Employee ID, Name, Email (removed Department)
- Validates each entry before adding
- Shows progress in activity log
- Displays summary modal with success/error count

**How it works:**
1. User selects CSV file
2. Upload button becomes enabled
3. Clicks "Upload Employees"
4. System processes each line:
   - Parses: Employee ID, Name, Email
   - Validates all required fields
   - Adds to database
   - Logs success/error for each employee
5. Shows final summary: "Successfully added X employees. Failed: Y"

---

### 4. ‚úÖ White Background for System Activity Log

**Problem:** Activity log had dark background making text hard to read.

**Solution:**
- Changed background from `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)` to `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.95)`
- Changed text color to `#333` (dark gray) for better readability
- Added subtle border for definition
- Maintained colored status indicators:
  - Success: Green (#28a745)
  - Error: Red (#dc3545)
  - Info: Blue (#17a2b8)
  - Warning: Yellow (#ffc107)

---

### 5. ‚úÖ Real-Time Status - All Fonts White

**Problem:** Some fonts in real-time status section were not white (used #00C7FD).

**Solution:**
- Updated all text and labels to pure white color
- Added explicit `color: white` to the container div
- Changed `<strong>` tags from `color: #00C7FD` to `color: white`
- Ensures consistent visibility across all browsers

---

### 6. ‚úÖ Bus Deletion Protection (Active Bookings)

**Problem:** Admin could accidentally delete a bus with active bookings.

**Solution:**
- Added validation in `deleteBus()` backend function
- Checks for active bookings before deletion
- Prevents deletion if:
  - Bus has bookings with status = 'active'
  - Booking date is today or in the future
- Shows professional error message:
  > "Cannot delete bus with active bookings. Please cancel all bookings first or wait until they expire."

**Backend Logic:**
```php
// Check for active bookings on this bus
$bookings = loadBookings();
$today = date('Y-m-d');
$hasActiveBookings = false;

foreach ($bookings as $booking) {
    if ($booking['bus_number'] === $busNumber && 
        $booking['status'] === 'active' && 
        $booking['schedule_date'] >= $today) {
        $hasActiveBookings = true;
        break;
    }
}

if ($hasActiveBookings) {
    return error message;
}
```

---

### 7. ‚úÖ Time Format Display (12-hour format)

**Problem:** Bus departure time showing as 16:06 instead of 4:06 PM.

**Solution:**
- Created `formatTime()` utility function
- Converts 24-hour format (HH:mm) to 12-hour format (h:mm AM/PM)
- Applied to all bus list displays

**Format Examples:**
- `08:30` ‚Üí `8:30 AM`
- `16:06` ‚Üí `4:06 PM`
- `17:30` ‚Üí `5:30 PM`
- `00:00` ‚Üí `12:00 AM`

---

### 8. ‚úÖ Employee Edit and Delete Buttons

**Problem:** No edit/delete actions in employee list.

**Solution:**
- Added "Actions" column to employee table
- Added Edit (‚úèÔ∏è) button for each employee
- Added Delete (üóëÔ∏è) button for each employee

**Edit Functionality:**
- Loads employee data into form
- Switches to "Add Employee" tab
- Disables Employee ID field (cannot change ID)
- Changes button to "‚úèÔ∏è Update Employee"
- Saves changes via PUT endpoint

**Delete Functionality:**
- Shows professional confirmation modal
- Deletes employee via DELETE endpoint
- Refreshes employee list automatically

---

### 9. ‚úÖ Department Column Removed from List

  - Employee ID

## Technical Details

### Modal System Implementation

if (confirmed) {
    // User clicked confirm
} else {
    // User clicked cancel
}
```

### CSV Processing
```javascript
// Read file as text
const text = await fileData.text();
const lines = text.split('\n').filter(line => line.trim());

// Skip header, process data
const dataLines = lines.slice(1);
for (const line of dataLines) {
    const [field1, field2, ...] = line.split(',').map(s => s.trim());
    // Process each row
}
```

### Time Conversion

function formatTime(time24) {
    const [hours, minutes] = time24.split(':');
    const hour = parseInt(hours);
    const ampm = hour >= 12 ? 'PM' : 'AM';
    const hour12 = hour === 0 ? 12 : (hour > 12 ? hour - 12 : hour);
    return `${hour12}:${minutes} ${ampm}`;
}
```

# Admin Panel Fixes - October 2, 2025

## Summary of Changes

All issues in the admin panel (http://localhost:8080/admin-new.html) have been fixed.

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Booking Widget - Active/Cancelled Filter
**Problem:** Booking widget didn't show filtering options for active and cancelled bookings.

**Solution:**
- Added three filter buttons: "All Bookings", "Active Bookings", and "Cancelled Bookings"
- Modified `loadBookings()` function to accept a status parameter ('all', 'active', 'cancelled')
- Updated API endpoint to support filtering: `/admin/recent-bookings?status={status}`
- Added status column to the bookings table showing ‚úÖ Active or ‚ùå Cancelled

**Backend Changes:**
- Modified `getAdminBookings($statusFilter)` function in `production-api.php` to filter bookings by status
- Added new route: `GET /admin/recent-bookings?status={status}`

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Removed Home and User View Widget
**Problem:** Navigation had unnecessary "Home" and "User View" links.

**Solution:**
- Removed the following navigation items:
  - `<a href="/admin-advanced.html">üè† Home</a>`
  - `<a href="/working.html">üë§ User View</a>`
- Kept only essential admin navigation: Dashboard, Buses, Employees, Bookings

---

### 3. ‚úÖ System Activity Log Under Dashboard Widget
**Problem:** Activity Log was in a separate section instead of being under Dashboard.

**Solution:**
- Moved the Activity Log section from standalone to be part of the Dashboard section
- Renamed to "System Activity Log" for clarity
- Added proper spacing and styling within the Dashboard
- Log is now visible when Dashboard tab is active

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Fixed Dashboard Bus Count Bug
**Problem:** Dashboard showed incorrect bus counts (dividing total by 2 instead of counting by slot).

**Solution:**
- Changed from `Math.floor(totalBuses/2)` to actual slot-based counting
- Added proper filtering:
  ```javascript
  const morningBuses = busesResult.data.filter(bus => bus.slot === 'morning').length;
  const eveningBuses = busesResult.data.filter(bus => bus.slot === 'evening').length;
  ```
- Now correctly displays the actual number of buses for each slot

---

### 5. ‚úÖ Added Edit and Delete Buttons in Bus List
**Problem:** Bus list had no way to edit or delete buses.

**Solution:**
- Added "Actions" column to bus list table
- Added ‚úèÔ∏è Edit button for each bus
- Added üóëÔ∏è Delete button for each bus
- Implemented `editBus(busNumber)` function that:
  - Loads bus data into the form
  - Switches to Add Bus tab
  - Changes "Add Bus" button to "Update Bus"
  - Disables bus number field during edit
- Implemented `deleteBus(busNumber)` function with confirmation dialog
- Implemented `updateBus(busNumber)` function
- Added `resetBusForm()` helper function to reset form state

**Backend Changes:**
- Added `PUT /admin/bus/{busNumber}` endpoint for updating buses
- Added `DELETE /admin/bus/{busNumber}` endpoint for deleting buses
- Added `updateBus()` and `deleteBus()` functions in `production-api.php`

---

### 6. ‚úÖ Fixed Add Bus Button
**Problem:** Add Bus button wasn't working properly.

**Solution:**
- Modified `addBus()` function to include user feedback:
  - Shows alert when bus is successfully added
  - Shows alert when there's an error
  - Better error messages in Activity Log
- Calls `resetBusForm()` after successful addition
- Automatically refreshes bus list after adding

**Backend Changes:**
- Added `POST /admin/add-bus` endpoint
- Added `addBus($data)` function in `production-api.php`
- Validates all required fields
- Checks for duplicate bus numbers
- Stores buses in `/var/www/html/data/buses.json`

---

### 7. ‚úÖ Removed Department Field from Employee Form
**Problem:** Department field was shown but not needed for employees.

**Solution:**
- Removed department input field from employee add form
- Updated form to only have:
  - Employee ID (required)
  - Full Name (required)
  - Email Address (required)
- Modified `addEmployee()` function to not include department
- Updated backend to make department optional

---

### 8. ‚úÖ Fixed Add Employee Button
**Problem:** Add Employee button wasn't working.

**Solution:**
- Modified `addEmployee()` function to:
  - Show alert when employee is successfully added
  - Show alert when there's an error
  - Better validation messages
  - Clear form after successful addition
  - Refresh employee list automatically

**Backend Changes:**
- Added `POST /admin/add-employee` endpoint
